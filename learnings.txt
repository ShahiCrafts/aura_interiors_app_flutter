EQUATABLE:

- Equatable allows value-based equality instead of default reference-based equality.

- Example:
    ```
    final state1 = SignupState(email: 'test@example.com', password: '1234');
    final state2 = SignupState(email: 'test@example.com', password: '1234');

    print(state1 == state2); // true
    ```

- Explanation:
    - Without Equatable, Dart compares objects by reference, so two instances are always different.
    - By extending Equatable and overriding `props`, equality is based on the values of the fields in `props`.
    - This is very useful in Bloc, so the framework can detect state changes correctly.
